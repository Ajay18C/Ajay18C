## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I architect and build **production-grade systems** that solve real business problems at scale. With expertise spanning cloud infrastructure, enterprise integrations, and AI-powered applications, I specialize in turning complex technical requirements into elegant, maintainable solutions.

My work focuses on three core areas:
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** ‚Üí Designing serverless and microservices-based systems on AWS
- **AI & Automation** ‚Üí Building RAG pipelines and intelligent document processing systems
- **Enterprise Integration** ‚Üí Connecting disparate systems through robust APIs and workflows

I approach every project with a **systems-thinking mindset**, prioritizing scalability, reliability, and developer experience from the ground up.

## üöÄ Featured Work

### Enterprise & SaaS Platforms

**Multi-Tenant Digital Licensing System**  
Architected microservices-based SaaS platform using Spring Boot with real-time WebSocket communication, config-driven React UI, and dynamic Excel reporting. Designed for scalability across multiple tenants with isolated data boundaries.

**Insurance Comparison & Analytics Platform**  
Built full-stack application with Spring Boot microservices and React frontend. Integrated AWS Textract for intelligent document parsing and template-based report generation serving enterprise clients.

### Cloud-Native Solutions

**Live Technical Interview Platform**  
Developed real-time coding assessment platform with integrated video streaming using AWS Lambda, Guacamole, and NICE DCV. Infrastructure fully automated with Terraform for reproducible deployments.

**Enterprise Payment Processing Pipeline**  
Engineered high-throughput ETL system for Coca-Cola processing millions of daily transactions. Built on AWS Lambda and MongoDB with automated error handling and reconciliation workflows.

### AI & Intelligent Systems

**AI-Powered Document Generation Suite**  
Created GenAI application transforming unstructured text into structured documents using LangChain and LightRAG. FastAPI backend with React frontend featuring real-time preview and contextual suggestions.

**Automated Invoice Processing System**  
Developed intelligent extraction pipeline using AWS Textract and FastAPI, reducing manual data entry by 90%. Handles multi-format documents with ML-powered validation and exception handling.

### Enterprise Integrations

**Salesforce Integration Hub**  
Designed and implemented comprehensive integration layer connecting Salesforce with payment processors, document management systems, GIS platforms, and DocuSign. Standardized API contracts across all services.

## üí° Technical Philosophy

I believe exceptional software emerges from the intersection of **technical rigor** and **pragmatic problem-solving**. My approach emphasizes:

**Architecture First** ‚Üí Design systems that are maintainable, testable, and scalable from day one  
**Cloud-Native by Default** ‚Üí Leverage serverless and managed services to focus on business logic  
**AI as Enhancement** ‚Üí Apply machine learning where it delivers measurable value, not as decoration  
**Documentation as Code** ‚Üí Treat documentation with the same care as implementation

---

## üìà Current Focus

- Advancing **RAG architectures** and knowledge graph integration for enterprise AI applications
- Exploring **event-driven patterns** and distributed systems design
- Contributing to **open-source projects** in the cloud-native ecosystem
- Deepening expertise in **prompt engineering** and LLM orchestration

## üì´ Let's Build Something

I'm open to discussions about:
- Complex system design challenges
- Cloud architecture and AWS best practices  
- AI/ML integration strategies
- Open-source collaboration opportunities
